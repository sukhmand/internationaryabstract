                        <p>The UW is home to nearly 8,000 international students representing more than 100 countries.</p>
                        <p>There is a lot of information that International students need to be able to adjust to this new place. Coming from a totally different education system and an entirely different culture, an international student needs to feel confident about where he/she is going and how to have a successful life there, and even while at college, they should be able to access and know about resources which are available to them. Researching and collecting information is a cumbersome process and students might miss some useful information or get the wrong information which might hurt them in the long run.</p>
                        <p>The amount of money that families of international students spend on their children is huge. So the impact of a student not being able to adjust is not only on the student but their families as well. This can lead to:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wastage of hundreds of thousands of dollars with no return</li>
                            <li>Effect on mental health of family and the student</li>
                            <li>Financial instability of the family</li>
                            <li>The student feeling out of place in a new country and place.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <p>How can international students easily obtain necessary information to ease their transition at the University of Washington without getting confused?</p>

     data-aos-duration="1000">Stakeholders</h2>
                        <p>Our key stakeholders are</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>International students at the University of Washington – They will be our main stakeholder as well as our user group. This includes anyone who is not a US resident and is either enrolled or even planning to potentially join UW.</li>
                        <li>International Student Services, UW – The ISS office advises F1, J1 students on any questions they might have and helps them navigate the issues students face. Their goal is to make international students feel comfortable and so is ours. In the future, Internationary is open to integrate information about immigration and visas from ISS to become an even more comprehensive resource</li>
                        <li>Parents</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="mb-3"  data-aos="fade-up"
     data-aos-duration="1000">Target Users</h2>
                        <p>The main target user group will be International students at the University of Washington, but this may extend to resident students too in some cases as some information might be useful to them as well. </p>

     data-aos-duration="1000">Solution - Project Overview</h2>
                        <p><b>Internationary</b> is a one-stop website with answers to most questions that international students have. It aims to help students adapt quickly to the life at the University of Washington, which in most cases is totally different from the one they had before. This is done by providing essential information about transportation, finances, healthcare, and housing in an organized manner and connecting students to external resources when needed.</p>

                    <div class="col-12 second-section">
                        <h2 class="mb-3"  data-aos="fade-up"
     data-aos-duration="1000">Impact</h2>
                        <p>The first impact of our solution is on the international students. If they can adjust well, they will perform well in school and gain more knowledge and even secure better jobs and. This in turn will also protect theirs’ and their families’ mental and financial stability. </p>
                        <p>Additionally, this solution also impacts the US universities and economy. 
                        “From the US perspective Our local higher ed institutions have long recruited students from around the world, recognizing the significant benefit of bringing their diverse perspectives onto our campus and into our classrooms.
                        </p>
                        <p>To continue providing these invaluable experiences for our domestic students, the U.S. must remain competitive in attracting top-tier international students – despite the repeated efforts by the current administration to discourage and complicate that effort.</p>
                        <p>International students are also critical to the health of our economy – both on campus and in the surrounding community. Foreign students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $41 billion to our national economy and supported more than 458,290 jobs in the 2018-2019 academic year alone.</p>
                        <p>At Cornell, international students contributed $304.2 million to the economy and supported 3,976 jobs during that same period. Another 200 international students at Ithaca College contributed $8.6 million supporting 48 jobs.</p>
                        <p>About 66% of all domestic full-time students receive some form of financial aid, which many say is the single most important factor in determining whether to attend college. Due to the economic recession wrought by the pandemic, those figures are rising.</p>
                        <p>Schools rely on the students who can pay full tuition to provide those who cannot with assistance, which, as research has shown, significantly improves both professional and financial success. International students bring additional revenue to local communities and businesses. And following graduation, 45% of foreign students extend their visas to work in the same area as their college or university, continuing these contributions.” (Source: Ithaca Journal)</p>

     data-aos-duration="1000">Future</h2>
                        <p>We would like to continue working on and improving the website
                        Would like to expand it to other UW campuses
                        Also prefer to expand it to other schools in WA and other states with high number of international students
                        Lastly, we will open our project and resources to anyone who would like to continue this project for their capstone next year
